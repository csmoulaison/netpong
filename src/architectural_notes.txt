SERVER STATES:

Idle
Accepts connections from clients, sending back an acceptance. Once both 
connections have sent back an accept acknowledgement, the server switches to 
active mode, sending a start game packet to both clients.

Active
No longer accepts connections from clients. Instead, continually simulates and
sends update packets to both connected clients. If the server receives a 
disconnect packet from a client, we send a game end packet to the other client
and switch to idle mode.
The server continues to send start game packets to each client until it receives
it's first update from that client.

Flow:
